-- Answer
    SELECT name FROM world
  where continent = 'Europe'
  and gdp/population > (select gdp/population from world where name ='united Kingdom');

-- 3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.
-- Answer
  select name, continent from world
  where continent IN (select continent from world where name ='Argentina' or   name = 'Australia' )
  order by name;

-- Answer
  select name, population from world
  where population > (select population from world where name = 'United Kingdom')

--  Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
-- Answer
  select name, 
  concat(cast(round(population/(select population from world where name = 'Germany')*100,0) as int), '%') percentage
  from world
  where continent = 'Europe';

-- 6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
-- Answer
  select name from world
  where gdp > (select max(gdp) from world where continent ='Europe');

-- 7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:
--  The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.
-- Answer
  SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
    WHERE area >= ALL
      (SELECT area FROM world y
          WHERE y.continent=x.continent
            AND area>0);

-- 8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
-- Answer
  select continent, name
  from world
  where name in (select min(name) from world group by continent);

-- 9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. 
--  Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
-- Answer
  select name,continent, population from world a
  where 25000000 >= ALL(select population from world b
  where a.continent = b.continent
  and population is not null);

-- 10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent).
--  Give the countries and continents.
-- Answer
  select name, continent from world a
  where a.population > ALL
  (select population*3 from world b
  where a.continent = b.continent
  and a.name != b.name);
